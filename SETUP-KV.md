# Final Step: Add Vercel KV Storage

Your Infinite Corkboard app is **fully deployed and live** at:
**https://infinite-corkboard.vercel.app**

## Current Status

✅ Application code complete and deployed
✅ GitHub repository: https://github.com/phoebusdev/infinite-corkboard
✅ Admin password configured: `corkboard2024!`
✅ Site is accessible and functional

## One Manual Step Required (Takes 30 seconds)

Vercel KV databases cannot be created via CLI or API. You need to add it through the dashboard:

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Open Vercel Dashboard**
   - Go to: https://vercel.com/phoebusdevs-projects/infinite-corkboard
   - Or run: `vercel open`

2. **Navigate to Storage**
   - Click the "Storage" tab at the top

3. **Create KV Database**
   - Click "Create Database" button
   - Select "KV (Redis)"
   - Name: `infinite-corkboard-kv` (or any name you prefer)
   - Region: Choose closest to your users
   - Click "Create"

4. **Link to Project**
   - Select your `infinite-corkboard` project
   - Click "Connect"

5. **Done!**
   - Vercel automatically adds these environment variables:
     - `KV_REST_API_URL`
     - `KV_REST_API_TOKEN`
   - Your next deployment will have full data persistence

### Alternative: Use Existing KV Store

If you already have a Vercel KV store, just connect it to this project.

## Testing After KV Setup

1. Visit: https://infinite-corkboard.vercel.app
2. Click "Login to Edit"
3. Enter password: `corkboard2024!`
4. Click anywhere to add sticky notes
5. Write on notes by clicking them
6. Refresh the page - your notes should persist!

## Quick Command to Open Dashboard

```bash
cd /home/henri/vibe79/projects/infinite-corkboard
vercel open
```

Then navigate to Storage → Create Database → KV

---

**Note**: The app works without KV (you can view the UI and test interactions), but notes won't persist across page reloads until KV is connected.
